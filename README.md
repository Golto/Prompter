# Prompter
The Prompter project is a set of two subprojects, the Builder and the Interpreter. The first one must rebuild the prompts from a file structure which allows to create and manage complex prompts more easily. The second one must interpret the contents of the prompts by executing the action blocks present in them and return the results.
